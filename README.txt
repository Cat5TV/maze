Hedge Maze (maze) mod for Minetest


by thefamilygrog66

Description:
Here's a mod that is based on an old BASIC script that I used to play around with back in the early 1980s(!). 

The player crafts a hedge maze block, which when right-clicked, randomly generates a 3-block high, 39x39 hedge (well, cactus) maze, complete with a start and finish. 

Recipe:

	Maze Generating Block

	+---------------+---------------+---------------+
	|  desert stone |  desert stone |  desert stone |
